# dravidian-codemixed

This repository contains the scripts used for UMSNH-INFOTEC’s participation in the first Sentiment Analysis in DravidianCode-Mixed text task on FIRE 2020. Our solution combines several models that solve the task separately; we then construct a final decision through differential evolution and the linear combination of models’ independently computed decision-values. The generic text categorization system 𝜇TC achieves the best performance when a single model is used, and our combined output improves individual performances.
